# StrEngPythonBook
Repository containing my 10-chapter course on Python. 
This course was aimed at up-skilling structural engineers and promoting the use of Python to automate areas of engineering, giving them more time to work on the parts they love.

If you want to run through this course yourself, open the directory and begin with the 'Getting Started' pdf.

Note: This course was created for colleagues at a previous employer, so references within the Notebook to external pdf's and internal filepaths are to be kindly ignored.
