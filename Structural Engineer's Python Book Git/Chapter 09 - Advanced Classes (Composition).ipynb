    "# Chapter 09: Advanced Classes (Composition)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will explore some more advanced methods of dealing with classes, in particular setting their attributes in a more flexible manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we explored Inheritance, using previously defined classes to set the attributes of a new class. While this is a powerful and very useful concept, it is not perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance works in a linear manner, only passing down the hierarchy. This works when the hierarchy is clear, and we only need our new class to take attributes from one previously written. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this restricts the layout of our script and reduces flexibility of changes, and when our classes need properties from one another and/or it isn't a direct hierarchy, inheritance becomes confusing and sometimes impossible to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where class composition comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of setting the class to inherit from in the first line of our class definition, we can pass objects of another class into our new class's __ init __ function, and take the attributes that way.\n",
    "\n",

    "As you can see, we've now 'inherited' class attributes from Steel into Plate, but the order of the code is more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: We can skip the middle-man and pass the Steel class straight into our fin object (using fin = Plate(Steel())), but depending on your style and the context, using separated objects may be more convenient.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, inheritance will work fine for simple cases, but composition is another tool in the toolkit for defining classes, and can be a neater method, depending on your stylistic preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where composition can really shine is explained later in this chapter, but first we should learn some other techniques.\n",

    "## Setting Class Attributes Using Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed in Chapter 7, setting all of the attributes of a class can be quite a laborious process, particularly when working with a large number of parameters (think how many different properties and modification factors Timber has). Fortunately, there are ways of expediting the process if we have a dataset/dictionary to work from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll be using the concepts of *args and **kwargs. It's not completely necessary to understand exactly how these work, but it might be useful, and you can find out more at the following links:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/args-kwargs-python/\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples_unpack.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes in Python have a built-in function 'setattr()'. This function allows us to set an attribute of a class in a slightly different way to what weâ€™ve done before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we did:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tself.attr_name = attr_value\n",
    "\t\n",
    "With setattr(), we can instead perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tsetattr(self, attr_name, attr_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionally, they work the exact same way. When we later call 'self.attr_name', Python will return 'attr_value'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where this comes in handy is when we have a dictionary of various attributes we want to assign. We input the dictionary within our __ init __ function with the following convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "class My_Class():\n",
    "\tdef __ init __ (self, **kwargs):\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Here, the **kwargs represents our dictionary keys and values. More about **kwargs can be seen at the links above, but essentially it allows us to input an undefined number of attributes into our class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use 'setattr()' in a loop on kwargs.items() to define our class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "class My_Class():\n",
    "\n",
    "\tdef __init__(self, **kwargs):\n",
    "\t\tfor key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "\t\t\tsetattr(self, key, value)\n",
    "\n",
    "kwargs.items() turns the dictionary into a list of two tuples. The first tuple contains our dictionary keys, and the second contains the dictionary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our for loop extracts the key and value for each tuple in the dictionary, and passes it through setattr(). From this, we have set every key/value pair in our dictionary as its own attribute of our class, in just a few short lines of code.\n",
    "Let's see an example.\n",
