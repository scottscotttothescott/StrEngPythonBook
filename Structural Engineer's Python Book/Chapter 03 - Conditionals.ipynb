    "# Chapter 03: Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals are a very useful function in Python, particularly for tasks such as comparing items and checking results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional statements within Python are If, and Else, and Elif.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python compare values to one another. They perform this check using what is called a comparative operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparative operators that Python accepts in conditional statements are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ==                       - Equals\n",
    "    \n",
    "    !=                       - Not equal to\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >                        - Greater than\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <                        - Less than\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >=                       - Greater than or equal to\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <=                       - Less than or equal to\n",
